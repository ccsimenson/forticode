## ⚠️ Current Limitations

### Performance Considerations
- **Sequential Scanning**: Security checks currently run sequentially, which may be slow for large codebases
- **No Incremental Scans**: Full scans are performed each time without change detection
- **Resource Intensive**: No built-in resource throttling or prioritization
- **Limited Progress Feedback**: No detailed progress tracking during scans
- **No Scan Profiles**: Cannot save/load different scan configurations

### How to Mitigate
1. For large codebases, consider breaking scans into smaller directories
2. Schedule full scans during off-peak hours
3. Monitor system resources during scanning
4. Provide feedback on performance issues for future optimization

## 🔮 Future Possibilities

### 🤖 AI-Powered Features
- Intelligent security recommendations
- Automated code fixes
- Security pattern recognition

### 🔌 Plugin System
- Extensible architecture for custom rules
- Community-contributed security checks
- Integration with other security tools
